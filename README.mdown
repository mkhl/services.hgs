# Services Plugin for Google QSB

A Google Quick Search Box plugin to enable access to the Services menu.

## Usage

* Hit your QSB keyboard shortcut.

* Type the name of a service to summon it, e.g. "Open URL".  
  Each service item will have the icon of its containing application or bundle
  and a short description of the form "A service of â€¦".

* Optionally, "tab" into the service and enter some data, e.g. "google.com".

* Hit enter to perform the service.

Note that some services _require_ being provided with data, and will signal an
error if none is provided. This issue will be addressed in the future.

## Installation Instructions

After extracting the plugin, you will find a bundle called `Services.hgs`.
Copy this bundle to `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Quick Search
Box/PlugIns`, then restart QSB.

If you build the plugin from source (described below), install the
`Services.hgs` from your `build` directory instead.

## Build Instructions

Building this plugin requires that you set up two source trees in Xcode. You
will have to have the QuickSearchBox source tree downloaded to your machine.
Instructions on getting the QSB source tree can be found here:
http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/source/checkout

To set up the source trees in Xcode:

1. Go to "Xcode>Preferences" and click on the "Source Trees" icon.
2. Click on the "Plus" button on the left hand side of the window.
3. Set the "Setting Name" of your new tree to `QSBBUILDROOT`
4. Set the "Display Name" to `QSBBUILDROOT`
5. Set the path to the debug build directory for QSB. For me the path looks 
   like this `~/src/QuickSearchBox/QSB/build/Debug`. If you use a common build
   directory or some other customized build location, you will have to set it
   here.
6. Click on the "Plus" button again
7. Set the "Setting Name" of your new tree to `QSBSRCROOT`
8. Set the "Display Name" to `QSBSRCROOT`
9. Set the path to the root directory for QSB. For me the path looks 
   like this `~/src/QuickSearchBox`.

The plugin should now build cleanly.

You should only have to add the source trees to Xcode the first time you 
build a QSB plugin.
